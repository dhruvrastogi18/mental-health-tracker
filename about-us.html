					Integrative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
					CBT is a term used to describe a type of therapeutic treatment that incorporates strategies from both cognitive and behavioural therapies, as well as other scientifically proven evidence-based treatments. Panic, social phobia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalised anxiety and rumination, eating disorders, marital distress, anger, chronic pain, and trauma have all been shown to be highly effective with these treatments. CBT aids in the development of effective coping skills.<br><br>According to the cognitive therapy model, our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours are all intertwined and affect one another. Identifying unhelpful and distorted thinking, testing and modifying beliefs, and developing skills to distance oneself from one's thoughts are all examples of cognitive interventions. The premise is that our core beliefs and stories about ourselves that we developed as children continue to influence our current behaviours. These stories act as filters, distorting our perceptions and interactions with others and potentially leading to self-fulfilling prophecies in relationships. Cognitive interventions help people understand how their early childhood conditioning is affecting their current relationships and influencing their behaviours. The goal is to teach people how to recognise the link between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviours in order to develop behavioural flexibility.<br>

					Impulse Control &amp; Emotional Dysregulation
				</h1>
				<p class="text-justify">
					Emotional dysregulation is defined as a problem with controlling, regulating, and tolerating one's emotions and emotional reactions – impulse control. If you have trouble regulating your emotions, it's possible that you grew up in an environment where your feelings were dismissed or ignored. Your emotions may have been slapped in the face, and you may have been blamed or chastised for your emotional reactions. Growing up in a household where feelings and needs aren't acknowledged can lead to confusion and doubt about your own emotional experiences, such as thoughts, feelings, needs, yearnings, and urges.<br>
