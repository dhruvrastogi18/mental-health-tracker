## What's it about?
It's all about giving people with mental illnesses resources and assisting them in self-administering CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy).

## What is CBT?
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that teaches people how to recognise and change harmful or troubling thought patterns that affect their behaviour and emotions. 1 

Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on changing automatic negative thoughts that can exacerbate emotional problems, depression, and anxiety. These irrational negative thoughts have a negative impact on one's mood. 

CBT identifies these thoughts, challenges them, and replaces them with more objective, realistic ones.
